# C Programming Practice & Projects

Welcome to my C Programming repository! ðŸ‘‹ This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing the C language by solving various problems and building small projects.

I believe this repository can be a helpful resource for beginners who want to practice and improve their C programming skills. I update it regularly with new solutions and projects.

***

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories to keep things tidy:

### â”œâ”€â”€ `algorithm`
This directory contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems. Each file is a separate challenge, perfect for practicing logic and efficiency in C.

### â”œâ”€â”€ `c-basic`
Here you'll find solutions to fundamental C programming problems. This section covers core concepts like functions, loops, arrays, conditional statements, logic gates, and more. It's a great starting point if you're new to C.

### â”œâ”€â”€ `projects`
This section showcases some simple, hands-on projects I've built. These are great for understanding how to apply basic concepts to create a complete program. The current projects include:
* **BMI Calculator**
* **Number Guessing Game**
* **Student Result Management System**
* **Voltage Distribution System**

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

Each C file (`.c`) in the `algorithm` and `c-basic` directories is self-contained. Inside every file, you will find:
1.  **The problem statement** written as a comment at the top.
2.  **The complete C code solution** right below the problem description.

This format makes it easy to understand the problem and study the solution in one place.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any of the C files on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP file).
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name`)*

2.  **Navigate to the directory** containing the file you want to run.
    ```bash
    cd c-basic/
    ```

3.  **Compile the C file** using a compiler like GCC.
    ```bash
    gcc divisible.c -o divisible
    ```

4.  **Run the compiled executable.**
    ```bash
    ./divisible
    ```
